/// egui tracks widgets frame-to-frame using <c>Id</c>s.<br/>
///
/// For instance, if you start dragging a slider one frame, egui stores
/// the sliders <c>Id</c> as the current active id so that next frame when
/// you move the mouse the same slider changes, even if the mouse has
/// moved outside the slider.<br/>
///
/// For some widgets <c>Id</c>s are also used to persist some state about the
/// widgets, such as Window position or whether not a collapsing header region is open.<br/>
///
/// This implies that the <c>Id</c>s must be unique.<br/>
///
/// For simple things like sliders and buttons that don't have any memory and
/// doesn't move we can use the location of the widget as a source of identity.
/// For instance, a slider only needs a unique and persistent ID while you are
/// dragging the slider. As long as it is still while moving, that is fine.<br/>
///
/// For things that need to persist state even after moving (windows, collapsing headers)
/// the location of the widgets is obviously not good enough. For instance,
/// a collapsing region needs to remember whether or not it is open even
/// if the layout next frame is different and the collapsing is not lower down
/// on the screen.<br/>
///
/// Then there are widgets that need no identifiers at all, like labels,
/// because they have no state nor are interacted with.<br/>
///
/// This is niche-optimized to that <c>Option<id></c> is the same size as <c>Id</c>.
